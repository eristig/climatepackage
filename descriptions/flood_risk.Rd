\title{Index to assess risk of flooding from sea level rise}
\usage{
flood_risk(index_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{property_elevation}{property_elevation  is the feet above sea level of the property. Options are between 0 to 100ft.}

\item{flood_proofing_degree}{flood_proofing_degree is how the infrastructure of the building on the property is prepared for flooding, such as building on stilts or sandbags around the perimeter. Values ranked from 0 (none) to 5 (very high).}

\item{sea_level_rise}{sea level rise (feet)}

\item{storm_surge}{storm_surge (feet)}
}
\value{
Ranking (Very Low to Extreme) of how vulnerable a property is to being flooded based on sea level rise and storm surge.
}
\description{
Scientists predict sea level rise as a result of climate change. Many properties are at risk of flooding as a result based on many criteria including elevation above sea level and physical buffers of the property and structures. Parameters include property characteristics and water characteristics (sea level rise and storm surge).
